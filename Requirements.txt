Stripe integration
* Users should have Stripe custm. token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent the pro form from submitting and send card info to stripe.
Stripe will return card token
* Javascript will send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app 
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note wheter it's plan 1 or 2.
* Once validated Rails should send user info and card token to stripe server and stripe
will create a subscription and send back customer token.
* Rails can save customer token and user info in the DB
